Cloned from https://github.com/mfarache/micronaut-ms

The project did not appear to work for me so I have made it from scratch taking the content of the other project:


Been built into a micronaut project on micronaut:
```
 mn --version
| Micronaut Version: 1.0.0.M4
| JVM Version: 1.8.0_171
```

To run first either install consul locally and run `./consul agent dev` 
or if you have installed docker simply run `sudo docker run -p 8500:8500 consul`


1. To run 1 instance of thes beer billing waiter instances run this from within this project folder:

```
cd micronaut-ms

./gradlew beer-waiter:run  beer-billing:run --parallel

```

2. Then on separate instances launch the beer-billing
```
./gradlew beer-billing:run
```


3. Now open another billing app
```
./gradlew beer-billing:run
```

Repeat Steps 2 and 3 another few times.




Now open browser hit:

http://localhost:8082/waiter/beer/fred `{"name":"mahou","size":"MEDIUM"}`

Run again http://localhost:8082/waiter/beer/fred `{"name":"mahou","size":"MEDIUM"}`

Bill fred:
http://localhost:8082/waiter/bill/fred `{"cost":23.4,"deskId":8081}`

Start with Wilma

http://localhost:8082/waiter/beer/wilma `{"name":"mahou","size":"MEDIUM"}`

http://localhost:8082/waiter/bill/wilma `{"cost":11.7,"deskId":8081}`



Then run the `test.sh` script  watch all 3 billing systems

I have uploaded a video on you tube based on this branch:

Description: Triangulated websockets
-----
[beer-websocket: LocalSocket.java](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/micronaut-playground/blob/beerwebsocket-demo/micronaut-ms/beer-websocket/src/main/java/beer/websocket/LocalWebSocket.java)
This is referred to as websocket connection tab `/ls/` stands for local socket. This is used by beer-websocket application.
It is triggered by 
[TransactionWebsocket.java: bootService.shareSessions();](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/micronaut-playground/blob/dd13f9af63b764482d248c70e02df6ad6c289d82/micronaut-ms/beer-websocket/src/main/java/beer/websocket/TransactionWebSocket.java#L34) 
when a new `beer-billing` application opens a websocket connection to `TransactionWebsocket` aka `/ws/` socket connection.
It it then asked to go off and shared all the sessions between all the running instances of beer-websocket. So beer-websocket instance 1 sends all its connected websockets sessions to 2 and 2 sends to 1 and so on.
The websocket connections that it sends is declared at the top of    `TransactionWebsocket` found as:  `public static ArrayList<WebSocketSession> sessions = new ArrayList<WebSocketSession>();`


[beer-billing: TransactionWebsocket.java](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/micronaut-playground/blob/dd13f9af63b764482d248c70e02df6ad6c289d82/micronaut-ms/beer-billing/src/main/java/micronaut/demo/beer/TransactionWebSocket.java)
This is triggered only by `beer-websocket` application and it is when a socket application is started after there is existing running billing applications.
This simply receives `hostname:port` of remote billing application as a message for which is directly connects back to as a `client websocket`.
When you stop a `beer-websocket` this application detects it and removes it from the local list of clients during the [Flowable ping sending which happens every 10 seconds](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/micronaut-playground/blob/dd13f9af63b764482d248c70e02df6ad6c289d82/micronaut-ms/beer-billing/src/main/java/micronaut/demo/beer/service/BootService.java#L57-L61).

 
You should find a test.sh script in the application which can be used to test above scenario 

```

The websockerts has transmitted the same cost to all 3 instances of the beer-billing application.
